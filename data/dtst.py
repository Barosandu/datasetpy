The aforesaid case was decided prior to the precasting in 1960 of section 3 of CAP 333 by Law No. 7 of 1960 and before the coming into force of the Constitution. For example, it may now have to be decided by the appropriate court whether or not the inability to understand a certificate or a policy of insurance which is not drawn up in an official language of the Republic known by the offender can constitute “special reasons”. It is not for this Court, however, to express an opinion, at this stage, regarding the interpretation of the expression “special reasons”.""","""In the opinion of the Court, therefore, section 3 of CAP 333 is not on the face of it unconstitutional as being contrary to or inconsistent with paragraph 3 of Article 12. It is true sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 3 provide for a minimum punishment but, unlike the circumstances in which the Decisions of this Court in Cases Nos. 24/61[2]* and 41/61† were given, in the present Case such minimum punishment is provided for a specific offence, i.e. using a motor-vehicle without third party insurance, and not for a great multitude of offences under a whole Law. Moreover, the offence in question has invariably grave potential consequences and there is a discretion vested in the trial court not to impose, on certain grounds i.e. for “special reasons”, the minimum sentence provided for in sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 3.""","""As the aforesaid decision ofHassan MuharremvPoliceis not the subject-matter of this reference the Court does not propose to express an opinion about the constitutionality or otherwise of its effect should such decision be followed now. In case, however, by means of a judicial decision binding on a trial court, such a restrictive interpretation is to be placed on the expression “special reasons” in sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 3, as would lead any litigant to challenge it on the ground that it renders the section in question unconstitutional, it would then be for such trial court to refer the matter to this Court under Article 144, because the expression [*24] decision in paragraph 1 of Article 144 has been interpreted in Case No. 8/61* to mean,inter alia, a judicial decision binding on a trial court.""","""[1][1]*P.I. 344, Supplnt.

Under paragraph 5 of the same Article modification “includes amendment, adaptation and repeal”.""","""The Court is of the opinion that the expression “any court” in the said paragraph 4 includes this Court and that the definition of “modification”, as above, is sufficiently wide as to enable this Court, and any other court when acting in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court in the case ofThe Republic and Nicolas Puntopiou Loftis, 1 R.S.C.C. p. 30 at pp 34 and 35, to bring a particular Law into accord with the Constitution without departing from its object and effect more than necessary for such purpose.""","""It is very significant that “modification” is defined in paragraph 5 of Article 188 as including not only “amendment” but also “adaptation” which is a much wider notion, and the expression “necessary” in paragraph 4 of Article 188 is not intended to restrict adaptation to mere amendments conse- tial upon the conflict of a provision of law with the Constitu­tion. Adaptation involves a process of recasting in order to bring a provision of law into accord with the Constitution while preserving, at the same time, its object and effect as much as possible. This view is in accordance with well- established principles and practice followed by Constitutional Courts in other countries in similar circumstances. Any other view in this matter would also be contrary to both the object and the spritit of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 188.""","""Of course, as the Court has decided in the case ofHannis DjirkalliandThe Republic, 1 R.S.C.C. p. 36 at p.40, it is not possible under paragraph 4 of Article 188 to substitute a completely new piece of legislation for a previously existing one. Adaptation, however, in the aforesaid sense, does not offend at all against such a view and in each case it is a question of degree to be resolved in the light of what is reasonable and [*19] necessary on each particular occasion. To the extent to which a modification under paragraph 4 of Article 188 may be said to have a legislative effect There is no doubt that this is the express provision and purpose of the Constitution in this respect.""","""In this connection it is proper to refer to the judgments delivered in the High Court of Justice in Criminal Appeal No. 2420,Ratibe Muti Abdulhamid v Republic. The Court should, first, observe that those parts of such judgments which purport to resolve any ambiguity arising in relation to the interpretation of the Constitution are mere obiter dicta as it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court, and of no other court, to resolve such ambiguities. Subject to the above observation, it should be stated that the views expressed in their judgments by Mr. Justice OBriain, the President of the High Court, and Mr. Justice Vassiliades are not in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 188 in their correct interpretation, and are incompatible with the afore­said well-established principles and practice followed in other countries, whereas the conclusions arrived at in their judg­ments by Mr. Justice Zekia and Mr. Justice Josephides are substantially in accordance with such correct interpretation.""","""In the light of the above and in order that sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 12 and sub-section (2) of section 18 of CAP 96 may be brought into accord with Article 146 of the Constitution, under which this Court has competence in matters of this nature, the following modifications, under paragraph 4 of Article 188, are necessary :""","""(a) the words “three months” in sub-section (2) of section 12 to read “seventy-five days” ;""","""(b) the words “Governor-in-Council on appeal” in sub-section (3) of section 12 to read “Supreme Constitutional Court on a recourse”;""","""(c) the words “appeal to the Governor-in-Council” in sub-section (2) of section 18 to read “make a recourse to the Supreme Constitutional Court”.""","""In view of the above modifications, which are deemed under Article 188 to have taken effect as from the coming into operation of the Constitution, it is clear that in this Case the Notification in the Gazette concerning the street-widening scheme was incorrect in two respects, viz. regarding the period within which and the organ to which an appeal against the street-widening scheme could be made.""","""The relevant decision of the appropriate authority under section 12 of CAP 96, i.e. the street-widening scheme, cannot [*20] have effect without publication as prescribed by sub-section (2) of the said section 12.""","""Once the time within which and the organ before which the street-widening scheme may be challenged are included in such publication, then, in a case of this nature, they become essential ingredients thereof because they are inseparably interwoven with the very nature and object of such publication, viz. to enable any person affected thereby to make a recourse against the street-widening scheme.""","""In the present Case, as already stated, the relevant Notification contains incorrect statements in the above two material respects and this has resulted, in the opinion of the Court, in defeating the object of such Notification with the consequence that it cannot be said that publication has taken place as prescribed under sub-section (2) of a section 12 of CAP 96. Any other view on this point would result in jeopardizing the interests of all persons at large affected by the street-widening scheme and who may have been misled to their detriment by the incorrect statements in question.""","""In view of the conclusion of the Court that the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 12 of CAP 96 have not been properly complied with it follows that the relevant act or decision of the appropriate authority under the said section 12 has not yet reached that stage at which it could be made the subject-matter of a recourse before the Court. For that stage to be reached, so that the period of seventy-five days prescribed under both paragraph 3 of Article 146 and under sub-section (3) of section 12 of CAP 96, as modified above, shall commence (only at the expiration of which period the street-widening scheme shall become binding) the provisions of sub-section (2) of the said section 12 have first to be properly complied with.""","""For the reasons given above this recourse is premature and has to be dismissed as such.""","""*Eleni L.

In accordance with a direction given by a Judge of the Court on the 28th December, 1960, a review of which was not applied for by either party under rule 7 of the Supreme Constitutional Court (Temporary Provisions) Rules, 1960, the Attorney-General of the Republic was given an opportunity to present his views at the hearing of the legal issues in question. Accordingly the learned Attorney-General of the Republic appeared in person at the hearing and gave the Court the benefit of his views.""","""3.At the hearing of the legal arguments counsel for the Respondent informed the Court that he abandoned the objection contained in paragraph 8 of the Respondents Affidavit, which alleged that the present recourse is out of time. Nevertheless, the Court has to be satisfied, in the circumstances of this case, that the recourse is in fact not out of time.""","""4.It is provided in paragraph 3 of Article 146 that a recourse under that Article shall be made within a period of seventy-five days of the date when the decision or act which is the subject of the recourse was published or, if not published and in the case of an omission, when it came to the knowledge of the person making the recourse. In the prsent case the decision of the Respondent to refuse the grant of a permit to the Applicant under the provisions of the Streets and Buildings Regulation Law (CAP. 96), which was taken on the 9th August, 1960, was communicated to the Applicant on the 12th August, 1960. It is further provided in paragraph 4 of Article 190 of the Constitution that in computing any time with regard to a recourse to the Supreme Constitutional Court “the period between the date of the coming into operation” of the Constitution and the constitution of the Supreme Constitutional Court shall not be counted. The contsitution of the Supreme Constitutional Court was completed with the appointment of the President of the Court. This act, completing the constitution of the Court, was published under Notification No. 63 in the Gazette of the 23rd September, 1960. The Court is of the opinion, therefore, that for the purposes of computing the period of seventy-five days under paragraph 3 of Article 146, and by invoking paragraph 4 of Article 190, the material date in this respect should be the 23rd September, 1960, the date on which the above-mentioned final act of completion of the constitution of the Court was promulgated by publication [*19] in the Gazette.""","""In reckoning the period of seventy-five days regard should also be had to paragraph (a) of section 31 of the Interpretation Law (CAP.1), which,inter alia,provides that in computing time for the purposes of any Law or public instrument unless the contrary intention appears “a period of days from the happening of any event or the doing of any act or thing shall be deemed to be exclusive of the day in which the event happens or the act or thing is done”. Thus, excluding, therefore, the 12th August, 1960, the day on which the decision which is the subject-matter of the recourse was communicated to the Applicant, the remaining period of three days in August up to the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution on the 16th August, 1960, and the period of seventy-two days from the 23rd September, 1960, to the 3rd December, 1960, (i.e. the date on which the present application was filed in the Registry of this Court) together total a period of exactly seventy-five days and this recourse, therefore, has, in the opinion of this Court, been made within the period prescribed by paragraph 3 of Article 146.""","""5.It was also decided, at the hearing, with the consent of the parties, to defer the point raised in paragraph 7 of the Respondents Affidavit until the hearing of the substantive issues of this case, because it became apparent from what the counsel for the Respondent stated that the point in question is not a purely legal one which can conveniently be decided as a preliminary issue but is rather one which relates to the substance of the case itself.""","""6.The only preliminary issues remaining for consideration, therefore, are the two legal issues raised in paragraph 6 of the Respondents Affidavit.""","""These two legal issues might be summarised as follows:""","""(1)can this Court entertain an application under Article 146 of the Constitution which is in respect of a decision, act or omission which occurred before the coming into force of the Constitution?""","""(2)has the Supreme Constitutional Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal under section 18 of the Streets and Buildings Regulation Law (CAP. 96)?""","""7.For the sake of convenience it is proposed to deal with the second question first. The Court has come to the conclusion that upon the coming into force of the Constitution of the Republic the jurisdiction of the former Governor in Council to hear appeals under section 18 of CAP. 96 has vested, and continues to vest, in this Court for the following reasons:- [*20]""","""(a)Paragraph 1 of Article 188 of the Constitution, which, subject to other provisions in the Constitution, continues in force all laws of the former Colony of Cyprus which were in force on the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, provides that such laws shall, until amended, continue in force after that date but shall be construed and applied withsuch modification as may be necessaryto bring them into conformity with the Constitution. Paragraph 4 of the same Article provides also that any “court in the Republic applying the provisions of any such law which continues in force under paragraph 1 of this Article, shall apply it in relation to any such period, with such modification as may be necessary to bring it into accord with the provisions of this Constitution including the Transitional Provisions thereof”.""","""(b)The Governor-in-Council has ceased to exist under the Constitution and sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article 188 provides that “any reference to the Governor or the Governor-in-Council shall.... be construed as a reference to the President and the Vice-President of the Republic, separately or conjointly, according to the express provisions in this Constitution, to the House of Representatives in matters relating to exercise of legislative power other than those expressly reserved to the Communal Chambers, to the Communal Chamber concerned in all matters within its competence under this Constitution, and to the Council of Minsters in matters relating to exercise ofexecutivepower”. It is obvious, and the contrary has not been submitted, that the powers of the Governor - in - Council under section 18 of CAP. 96 are not within the powers of the President or the Vice-President of the Republic as expressly laid down in the Constitution, and, furthermore, such powers are not of a legislative nature. There only remains, therefore, the issue relating to the Council of Ministers. The question which thus arises is whether the powers of the Governor in Council to hear appeals under section 18 of CAP. 96 was anexecutivepower or ajudicialor aquasi-judicialpower. If it was an executive power then the provisions of paragraph 3 (b) of Article 188 relating to the Council of Ministers would apply. If it was a judicial power then paragraph 3 (b) cannot apply because it is quite clear from the express provisions of the aforesaid paragraph 3 (b) and of Article 54 and other relevant and connected provisions of the Constitution that the Council of Ministers cannot exercisejudicialorquasi-judicialpowers.""","""(c)An examination of the wording of section 18 of CAP. 96 (in which, it should,inter-alia, be noted, that the word“appeal”is used, as distinct from the words “application”, “petition” or “objection” etc.,) makes it quite clear that the function of the Governor in Council under section 18 was a judicial or quasi-judicial one and not an executive one. [*21]""","""A definition of a “judicial act”, which has been frequently approved either expressly or by implication, is that of May C.J. in the Irish case ofR.v.Dublin Corporation(1878), 2, L.R. Ir. 371, p. 376:-""","""“In this connection the term ‘judicial does not necessarily mean acts of a judge or of a legal tribunal sitting for the determination of matters of law, but for the purposes of this question a judicial act seems to be an act done by competent authority, upon consideration of facts and circumstances, and imposing liability or affecting the rights of others”.""","""The Court is of the opinion, after having carefully examined the various authorities on the subject referring,inter alia,to the English, German and French legal systems, and having considered the able arguments of all learned Counsel, that the function of the former Governor in Council under section 18 of CAP. 96 was ajudicialorquasi-judicialfunction.""","""(d) This being so, the Court has considered whether the whole of section 18 has ceased to exist as being repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution and, therefore, not saved under Article 188 in view of the fact that the Council of Ministers cannot under the Constitution discharge the judicial orquasi-judicial function of the Governor in Council under section 18 or whether, having regard to the establishment of the Supreme Constitutional Court, section 18 is still applicable, in a modified form, and only sub-section (4) of section 18 has ceased to exist.""","""The Supreme Constitutional Court has been set up as a separate administrative Court, with exclusive jurisdiction, modelled on similar courts in European countries. In the past, in the absence of such a Court, such administrative jurisdiction, very limited and inadequate by modern standards as it was, was shared by ordinary courts and some executive organs, according to the particular case. Under the provisions of Article 146 of the Constitution the power to adjudicate finally in matters concerning a decision, act or omission of any organ, authority or person exercising executive or administrative authority, such as that exercised by the Munisipal Corporation of Limassol under the provisions of section 3 of the Streets and Buildings Regulations Law, CAP. 96, is now within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court.""","""As the Court has come to the conclusion that the functions of the former Governor-in-Council under section 18 of CAP. 96, was a judicial orquasi-judicial function then section 18 as a whole is not fundamentally contrary to, or inconsistent with, the provisions of the Constitution, and must, therefore, be construed and applied with such modification as may be necessary to bring its provisions into conformity [*22] with the Constitution, and particularly Article 146 thereof. With regard to sub-section (4) of the said section 18, however, such provision is, in the opinion of the Court, fundamentally contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution and that sub-section no longer continues to be in force.""","""(e)The Court has also considered the possibility whether section 18 of CAP. 96 can be construed in conformity with the Constitution in such a way as to provide for an administrative review of the decision of the Respondent before the Applicant could have had recourse to this Court under Article 146 of the Constitution.""","""As the Court, however, has come to the conclusion that the powers vested in the former Governor-in-Council by section 18 of CAP. 96, was a judicial or quasi-judicial function, this possibility cannot arise in this case.""","""(f)It is convenient now to observe that the Court does not accept the argument that the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 188 of the Constitution, which substitutes new references and terminologies in the place of the old ones appearing in the laws of the former Colony of Cyprus, are exclusive but is of the opinion that all the laws saved by Article 188 must be “construed and applied with such modifitionas may be necessaryto bring them into conformity” with the Constitution.""","""Nor does the Court accept the submission that sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 188 is applicable in this case because the words“otherperson holding a public office” cannot be said to refer to the Governor-in-Council which is expressly referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of the said Article.""","""Finally, it suffices to say, for the purposes of this case, that the legal provision under consideration in this decision, is not a law “relating to the municipalities”, within the proviso to paragraph 2 of Article 188.""","""8.Having found that appeals under section 18 of CAP 96 now come within the competence of this Court the question raised in the first sub - paragraph of paragraph 6 of the Respondents Affidavit remains to be considered, i.e. whether this Court can entertain an application under Article 146 where the decision, act or omission in question took place before the coming into force of this Constitution.""","""9.The Court, in the present case, does not have to decide in general to what extent, if any, recourse may be had to this Court under Article 146 of the Constitution in respect of a decision, act or omission which has taken place and has [*23] become final before the coming into force of the Constitution, because, in this case, the Applicant had a right under section 18 of CAP. 96 to appeal against the decision of the Respondents refusal to grant a permit, within ten days from the date on which the decision was communicated to him, i.e. within ten days from the 12th August, 1960, and, therefore, such decision had not become final on the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution. The Constitution came into force on the 16th August, 1960, and immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution the Applicant had the aforesaid right of appeal under section 18 of CAP. 96 vested in him. Through no fault of the Applicant the coming into force of the Constitution prevented the Applicant from exercising that right within the full length of the period allowed by law, i.e. within the remaining seven days allowed by section 18, in as much as the coming into force of the Constitution resulted in the abolition of the Governor -in- Council as a body which could carry out the judicial orquasi-judicial function laid down in section 18 of CAP. 96. This being the case the lawful right which the Applicant had was left without a means of remedy and applying the well known maxim“ubi ius ibi remedium” (where there is a right there must be a remedy) this Court must consider whether it was the intention of the Constitution to deprive the citizen of such a right and if not to ascertain what organ or authority the Applicant could have had recourse to in order to enjoy the exercise of that right. The Constitution could not have intended to deprive a citizen of such a vested right and for the reasons given earlier the Court is of the opinion that the organ or authority of the Republic which corresponds to the Governor-in-Council, in the exercise of the judicial orquasi-judicial functions provided in section 18 of CAP. 96, is this Court. The Court, is, therefore, of the opinion that the Applicant is entitled to exercise his lawful right of appeal, which he had before the coming into force of the Constitution and which had not been extinguished by lapse of time or in any other way, by having recourse to this Court.""","""10. Regarding the question of costs involved in the determination of these legal issues, it is reserved until the conclusion of this case.""","""March, 2.

The provisions therein about a right of appeal and the use of the expression “the court” instead of “a court” in the first line of such paragraph indicate that “the court” in question is the civil court mentioned earlier and could not have been intended to be the Supreme Constitutional Court.""","""On the other hand, a great number of administrative or executive decisions, acts or omissions “in respect of or under any of the provisions” of Article 23 are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court by virtue of Article 146 of the Constitution.""","""In the opinion of the Court, the said paragraph 11 has to be construed in relation to both the whole of Article 23 and of the Constitution.""","""It should first be observed that it belongs to a part of the Constitution, namely Part II, which does not purport to deal by way of substantive enactment with the jurisdiction of courts of the Republic but only deals with Fundamental Rights and Liberties. Considered in this light, the obvious purpose of paragraph 11 of Article 23 is to affirm the right of recourse to a court, with particular view to the securing of a stay of proceedings.

The decision to acquire compulsorily may have been precipitated by the application of Applicant for a building permit, Exhibit 1, but it still amounted to pursuing, in good faith, a long established policy of the Municipal Authorities of Limassol for the betterment of the town going back to 1952. This is amply substantiated by Exhibits 11, 12, 13, 14 and 18. It is correct that a comparison of the plans, Exhibits 9 and 10, demonstrates that Exhibit 10, which is the plan for the proposed garden and [*27] parking place, cannot be implemented now in its original form because in 1958 a building permit granted to the Applicant enabled buildings to be erected on part of the proposed garden and parking space (as shown on Exhibit 9). Yet in the opinion of the Court such plan, Exhibit 10, was only a preliminary study of the matter and if it were possible for Respondent to acquire now the area in question effect could still be given to the purpose indicated by such plan.""","""The Court turns now to the question of the validity of the refusal of the Respondent on the 9th August, I960, to grant the building permit applied for. It has already been decided that such refusal wasbona fide.As the said decision was made before the 16th August, 1960, the date on which the Constitution came into force, its validity has to be determined in the light of the law then prevailing and of the manner in which such law was then being administered and interpreted. The Court, viewing such refusal in that setting, is not satisfied that the decision of the Respondent at the time was either illegal or made in excess or in abuse of power. Some support for this conclusion may be found in the judgment of the former Supreme Court of the Colony of Cyprus given on the 26th January, 1959, in Case Stated No. 128(Georghios Lordos and others v Government of Cyprus).""","""No useful purpose would be served by analysing inextensothe grounds on which the above conclusion is based for the simple reason that such course would be of no assistance to the parties in this case or to any other future litigants, because from the 16th August, 1960, onwards the relevant legislation, and in particular CAP. 96, has to be read subject to the Constitution and specifically Article 23 thereof, and to be applied with necessary modifications.""","""As the Applicant may apply afresh for a building permit in relation to the same project, the Court, with a view to enabling the parties to avoid, as far as possible, the expense of further litigation, has decided to express hereinunder in this judgment its opinion on certain questions concerning the interpretation and effect of Articles 23 and 188 of the Constitution.""","""(a)The requirement of applying for a building permit under section 3 of CAP. 96 is connected with the right of property safeguarded by paragraph 1 of Article 23, which includes the right to possess and enjoy property.""","""(b)Paragraph 2 of Article 23 provides that no deprivation or restriction or limitation of any such right shall be made except as provided in the said Article and paragraph 3 thereof provides:""","""“Restrictions or limitations which are absolutely [*28] necessary in the interest of the public safety or the public health or the public morals or the town and country planning or the development and utilization of any property to the promotion of the public benefit or for the protection of the rights of others may be imposed by law on the exercise of such right”.""","""It is noteworthy and significant that whereas “deprivation” is specifically mentioned in paragraph 2 in addition to “restriction or limitation” paragraph 3 provides only for “restrictions or limitations”.""","""(c)In the particular case where the owner is an ecclesiastical authority the position is governed specifically by paragraph 9 of Article 23 which reads as follows:""","""“Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article no deprivation, restriction or limitation of the right provided in paragraph 1 of this Article in respect of any movable or immovable property belonging to any See, monastery, church or any other ecclesiastical corporation or any right over it or interest therein shall be made except with the written consent of the appropriate ecclesiastical authority being in control of such property and the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 7 and 8 of this Article shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph :""","""Provided that restrictions or limitations for the purposes of town and country planning under the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article are exempted from the provisions of this paragraph”.""","""It is again noteworthy that wheareas “deprivation” is expressly mentioned in the main part of this paragraph, yet it is expressly omitted from the proviso thereto.""","""(d)In each case where a building permit is applied for it is a question of fact and of degree, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case whether the decision of the appropriate authority thereon amounts to a “deprivation” (within the meaning of the above provisions) and which can only be achieved under paragraph 4 of Article 23, or whether it amounts to “restriction or limitation” (within the meaning of the above provisions) which can only be imposed under paragraph 3 of the said Article , and in the particular case of an owner such as the Applicant, only under the proviso to paragraph 9 thereof.""","""(e)The laws relating to the municipalities within the meaning of the proviso to paragraph 2 of Article 188 of the Constitution, have to be applied, as from the 16th August, [*29] 1960, with such modifications as to bring them into conformity with the provisions of the Constitution, including Article 23 thereof, as in the case of all other laws. The proviso to paragraph 2 of Article 188 does not ensure that the laws relating to the municipalities are to be applied for the period stated therein in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution, but such proviso only qualifies the second phrase of the main part of the said paragraph 2 of Article 188, by providing for the continued operation, in accordance with the Constitution, nevertheless, for a limited time of those laws which require a separate majority under Article 78 of the Constitution.""","""In the circumstances of this case, the Court has reached the conclusion that this application should be dismissed. Applicant is not, however, prevented from applying again to the Respondent for a building permit.""","""In the present case the Court is of the opinion, applying principle (d) above, that at any rate the outright prevention of the Applicant from building at all on the property in question would amount to “deprivation” within the meaning of paragraphs 2 and 9 of Article 23.""","""The Court, finally, is of the opinion that, taking all matters into consideration, including the reserved question of the costs for the decision on preliminary legal issues, it is only fair for each party to bear its own costs.

Under the said provision a Committee had been set up for the examination of complaints in relation to appointments, promotions or transfers of educationalists. Though a decision for the “termination of services” does not appear to have been expressly included in the terms of reference of such Committee, nevertheless, even assuming that this should be deemed to be so in view of the fact that “appointments” were expressly included therein, in the opinion of the Court the proceedings before the said Committee had not been provided by way of confirmation or completion of the administrative act or decision concerned but only by way of a review.

Applicant had been appointed on probation until he would prove himself as an efficient teacher and the transfer of Applicant to Kannavia, which was effected during the currency of a school-year due to unsatisfactory conduct, cannot be deemed to signify an intention to treat the Applicant as having so proved himself as an efficient teacher.""","""Applicant was, therefore, still a probationer when his services were terminated on the 1st March, 1962.""","""Issue (3)""","""In order to determine this issue, the nature of the termination of the services of Applicant has to be examined with a view to ascertaining whether or not it was disciplinary. One of the grounds for the said termination was the fact that Applicants level of work was very low. That is clearly not a disciplinary ground(vide Maro N. PantelidouandThe Republic (Public Service Commission), 4R.S.C.C. p. 100). The other ground, which was equally relied upon by the appropriate authorities in dealing with the case of Applicant, as shown by the aforesaid minute of the 21st February and the letter of the 1st March, 1962, was his whole conduct and particularly his conduct towards his wife, which was the subject-matter of a decision by an ecclesiastical court.""","""The Court is of the opinion that a teachers conduct outside the school, be it towards his wife or towards others, which brings him into disrepute, may, in a proper case, be deemed to be misconduct related to his office, as being conduct prejudicial to the interests of education. A teacher educates his pupils not only by giving lessons to them but, to a certain extent, by his own living example as a person in the community. Such factor is taken cognizance of by the appropriate authorities, as shown by the contents of the relevant Inspectors report, dated the 13th February, 1962. The same view is also borne out by the wide terms in which section 31 of CAP. 166 is drafted.""","""The conduct, therefore, of the Applicant towards his wife, which led to the decision against him of an ecclesiastical court, being in the circumstances a matter which could bring him into disrepute, became conduct relevant from the disciplinary point of view and was properly taken into account by Respondent as a consideration relevant to the question of the termination of his services, though the Court leaves open the issue whether in this particular Case it was a sufficient consideration, in view of the lately otherwise good conduct of [*17] Applicant, as reported by the Inspector on the 13th February, 1962.""","""In the opinion of the Court, therefore, and in the light of its Judgments inNicos KalisperasandThe Republic (Public Service Commission) & another,3 R.S.C.C. p. 146 and other Cases, so long as the termination of the services of the Applicant appears to have been based with equal force both on inefficiency and disciplinary reasons as well, such termination ought to have been treated as a disciplinary matter, to the extent concerning the Applicants conduct towards his wife, and the appropriate procedure ought to have been applied, a thing which it is common ground that it has not been done. The fact that Applicants services could possibly have been terminated on the ground of inefficiency alone is not sufficient to save the validity of such termination once disciplinary reasons were relied upon also in a decisive manner, as in this Case. To put it at its lowest, there has arisen such a considerable doubt as to the essential and predominant purpose of the termination of the services of Applicant as to lead the Court to the above conclusion.""","""Furthermore, on the 22nd February, 1962, when the Committee of Education and the Committee of Selection and Administration of the Greek Communal Chamber approved the termination of the services of Applicant, provision had been made, under the then in force section 10 of the aforesaid Law No. 7/60, for the functioning in the Office of Greek Education of a Disciplinary Board composed of the Director as Chairman, the Heads of the Departments of Secondary and Elementary Education and two ex-educationalists, a master and a teacher, as members. In the opinion of the Court the only proper organ to decide on the question of the termination of the services of Applicant, from a disciplinary point of view, was the said Board, and this course has not been followed. Instead, upon a minute by the Head of the Department of Elementary Education to the Director, the aforesaid two Committees of the Greek Communal Chamber decided the matter.""","""It follows, therefore, that the termination of the services of the Applicant, for a disciplinary reason, has not been decided either by the competent organ or in the proper manner.""","""In the circumstances, it is not really material to decide whether, the Applicant being a probationer, he could have been dismissed under regulation 3 (e) of the Elementary Education (Registration and Payment of Teachers) Regulations. 1954*, or whether the provisions of section 31 of CAP. [*18]166 ought to have been applied, because a public officer, even if he is employed on probation or on an unestablished basis(vide Maro N. PantelidouandThe Republic (Public Service Commission), supra),should not have his services terminated for a disciplinary reason unless he has first been afforded an opportunity to be heard in answer to the case made against him. The reason for such a premise is that, though a probationer or unestablished officer still otherwise remains liable to termination of his services in accordance with the terms of his probationary or temporary employment, once a disciplinary element has been introduced, such element is a supervening extraordinary factor but for the introduction of which the probationary or unestablished service would have normally continued. It is required, then, by the rules of natural justice,inter alia,that a person should not be deprived, for disciplinary reasons, of the benefit of even a probationary or unestablished service without first being afforded an opportunity to be heard in his defence.""","""Before concluding, the Court considers it useful to observe that the form in which the letter of the 1st March, 1962, terminating the services of the Applicant, was written may be substantially regarded as a proper form for the purpose, and one that could and should properly be adopted by other appropriate authorities in similar circumstances, in that reasons are sufficiently given for such termination of services. The existence of a jurisdiction such as the one under Article 146 contains an implied directive to the authorities, which are subject to such jurisdiction, to endeavour to reason duly their relevant decisions. The absence of such reasoning, though not always necessarily, in itself, a ground for invalidating the particular decision, may prove to be a grave handicap towards effectively and convincingly supporting its validity in proceedings before this Court.""","""For theReasonsset out abovetheCourt declares as stated inThe Order.""","""*Refers to Education Office of the Greek Communal Chamber only.""","""†Repealed and replaced, subsequently, by s.2 of Law No. 6 of 1962, dated 16/4/62, official Gazette No. 145, Supplnt.

The plans in support of the Applicants application for such a permit contemplated the construction of a road joining plot No. 711 with the port access road and running across one of the road protecting strips.""","""The Mayor of Famagusta informed the Applicant, by a letter written on behalf of Respondent No.2 and dated the 10th February, 1961, (Exhibit 3), that the permit for which the Applicant applied could only be granted if the Applicant submitted revised plans which would comply with Notification No. 1119 regarding the port access road and the road protecting strips.""","""This Application was filed on the 3rd March, 1961, and originally contained seven motions for relief*.""","""By a Decision of this Court dated the 30th May, 1961, on preliminary objections which were taken on the first day of the hearing of this Case on the 24th April, 1961, only Claims Nos. 1, 2 and 6 of the Applicants motion for relief [*56] remained. These three Claims are set out in full in the above- mentioned Decision of this Court and need not be repeated here.""","""The Opposition of Respondent No. 1 was filed on the 29th March, 1961, and of Respondent No. 2 on the 30th March, 1961. Respondent No. 1 contends that the object for which the land comprising the road protecting strips had been acquired had not been abandoned or lapsed and Respondent No. 2 contends that its refusal to grant the Applicant the permit applied for was because in the plans submitted by the Applicant in support of his application for such a permit it is shown that the construction of a road across one of the road protecting strips and joining the Applicants proposed building sites with the port access road is envisaged.""","""On the 11th April, 1961, the Applicant filed an affidavit in reply to the said Oppositions.""","""The Case came up for mention on the 28th March, 1961. On the first day of the public hearing on the 24th April, 1961, certain preliminary legal issues were dealth with as stated above. The hearing of the Case was resumed on the 2nd October, 1961, and was completed on the 9th October, 1961, when Judgment was reserved until today.""","""The Court will first deal with Claim No. 6 of the Applicants motion for relief in which the Applicant asks for a declaration that the object of the road protecting strips has lapsed and that consequently the land which they comprise must either be ceded to the port access road or to any other road or be offered back for sale to the Applicant at the price at which the land of which they form part was acquired by the Government of the former Colony of Cyprus from the Applicant in 1956.""","""The purpose for which the land in question had been acquired is clearly and expressly specified in Notification No. 665*, namely, “to carry out extensions and improvements of the Famagusta Port and to provide for the development thereof”. There can be no doubt, in the opinion of the Court, that the construction of a port access road such as the port access road in question is within the object of carrying out “extensions and improvements of the Famagusta Port” as declared in Notification No. 665* and that the road protecting strips on either side of the port access road, which are essential for a road of this nature, are, therefore, also connected with the proposed “extensions and improvements” of the Port.""","""The question of fact which is raised by Claim No. 6 and [*57]which this Court must ascertain is whether the aforesaid object of carrying out “extensions and improvements of the Famagusta Port and to provide for the development thereof”, as specified in Notification No. 665*, has been abandoned before the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution or whether such purpose has not been attained since the coming into operation of the Constitution.""","""Section 13 of CAP 226 provides,inter cilia,that the acquiring authority “shall, within one year from the completion of the works or……from the abandonment of the undertaking in connection with which the land had been acquired, sell and dispose of any land which is found to be in excess of the extent actually required or to be no longer required for the purpose for which it has been acquired”.""","""The relevant provision of paragraph 5 of Article 23 of the Constitution provides that if within three years of the acquisition the purpose for which immovable property has been acquired has not been attained the acquiring authority shall, immediately after the expiration of the said period of three years, offer the property at the price it has been acquired to the person from whom it has been acquired.""","""As far as the question of any alleged abandonment of the undertaking having taken place before the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution is concerned and regarding any right which might consequently have been vested in the Applicant immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, the provisions of section 13 of CAP 226, which would have applied, must be considered.""","""As to any question concerning the alleged non-attainment of the purposes for which the land in question had been acquired since the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, the matter is governed by paragraph 5 of Article 23, and the corresponding provisions of CAP 226 must, in accordance with Article 188 of the Constitution, be read subject to the said paragraph 5.""","""The Court is satisfied on the evidence which has been adduced before it, and particularly from the evidence given by Mr. P. Kazamias, the Administrative Officer of the Ministry of Communications and Works, that the undertaking was never abandoned by the then acquiring authority, i.e. the Government of the former Colony of Cyprus, prior to the coming into operation of the Constitution. This finding is supported,inter alia,by the uncontested fact that provision was made in the annual Government Estimates for the expenditure [*58] of money in connection with the undertaking during the years between 1956 and I960.""","""The words corresponding to the word ““attained”, which appears in the second sentence of paragraph 5 of Article 23, in the original Greek text is“###”“###”and in the original Turkish text is “gerçekleşmediği (‘takdirde)”. The Court is of the opinion that the respective Greek and Turkish expressions in the respective authentic original texts convey the same notion i.e. that of “attainability”; in any case the notion which is intended to be conveyed by the English word “attained” in the context in which it is used in the English text of paragraph 5 of Article 23 of the Constitution is also the notion of “attainability”, and the word “attained” should be read as meaning “has become attainable”.""","""The Court is, therefore, of the opinion that the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 23 take effect if within three years of the acquisition the purpose for which the land in question had been acquired has not become “attainable”. Any other interpretation would lead to absurdity in that there are bound to be many purposes for which land has been acquired in the sense of paragraph 5 of Article 23, which, by their very nature, cannot be fulfilled within the said period of three years.""","""It is quite clear in this Case, on the evidence adduced before the Court and particularly having regard to Decision No. 890 of the Council of Ministers dated the 22nd June, 1961, (Exhibit 21), that the purpose for which the land in question had originally been acquired is at the present time capable of being attained, that is to say, it is attainable.""","""The Court is, therefore, of the opinion that neither of the two above-mentioned sets of circumstances, which are respectively referred to in section 13 of CAP 226 and in paragraph 5 of Article 23 of the Constitution, have come about in this Case during the material periods so as to bring into operation the two provisions in question.""","""For the reasons given above Claim No. 6 of the Applicants motion for relief cannot succeed and is accordingly dismissed.""","""Coming now to Claims Nos. 1 and 2 of the Applicants motion for relief.""","""The first question which has to be considered is whether the decision of Respondent No. 2 not to grant the application made by the Applicant on the 5th January, 1961, for a permit under section 3 of CAP 226 to lay out or divide the land in question into separate building sites is unconstitutional [*59] illegal or made in excess or abuse of powers.""","""Section 3 of CAP 96, provides,inter alia, that no person shall erect any building or lay out or divide any land into separate sites without a permit in that behalf first obtained from the appropriate authority. Sub-section (2) of that section provides that the appropriate authority within the area of a municipal corporation shall be the municipal council of such corporation, i.e. in this Case Respondent No. 2.""","""Sub-section (1) of section 4 of CAP 96 provides that “no permit shall be granted under section 3” of CAP 96 “unless the appropriate authority is satisfied that the contemplated work or other matter in respect of which the permit is sought is in accordance with the provisions of” CAP 96 and the Regulations made thereunder in force for the time being.""","""Although section 4 of CAP 96 only lays down that the contemplated work or other matter in respect of which a permit is sought under section 3 of that Law has to be in accordance with the provisions of CAP 96 and the Regulations made thereunder, the provisions of CAP 96 cannot, in the opinion of the Court, be interpreted as authorising an appropriate authority to issue permits thereunder which would result in the contravention of some other Law.""","""In this Case it is clear that the granting of the permit applied for would be contrary to the provisions of CAP 226 in the sense that it would prevent the object for which an undertaking of public utility had been declared, and in respect of which the land in question had been acquired under CAP 226 (which object includes the construction of a port access road with road protecting strips), from being achieved, thus defeating the objects and operation of that Law.""","""The granting by Respondent No. 2 of the permit for which the Applicant had applied would also have the effect of Respondent No. 2 allowing or condoning the construction of a road by the Applicant on property (i.e. road protecting strips) which does not belong to the Applicant without first obtaining the consent of the owner of such land, (i.e. the Republic) to construct such road on the property of the Republic. Particularly so when it is obvious to Respondent No. 2 from the very wording of Notification No. 1119 itself that it is the decision of the owner of such protecting strips, i. e. the Republic, that they should not form part of a public road.""","""Furthermore, it is provided bysub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (1) of regulation 5 of the Streets and Buildings Regulations made under CAP 96 (hereinafter referred to as “the Regulations”) that an application for a building permit under CAP 96 shall be accompanied by a site plan showing, [*60]inter alia,“the access to the plot from some existing street”.""","""The appropriate authority in this Case, i.e. Respondent No. 2, in considering applications for a permit to divide land into plots for building purposes under regulation 3 of the Regulations (being the same appropriate authority for the granting of applications for building permits under regulation 5) must have due regard to the requirements under regulation 5 concerning building permits.""","""As stated before, an appropriate authority must be satisfied, as required by sub-section (1) of section 4 of CAP 96, that the contemplated work or other matter in respect of which a permit is sought under section 3 of that Law is in accordance with the provisions of CAP 96 and the Regulations made thereunder in force for the time being before it can lawfully grant such a permit. The granting of a permit under regulation 3 clearly envisages the division of land “into plots for building purposes” and, therefore, no such permit can lawfully be granted thereunder unless, in respect of each resulting plot, it is possible under the Regulations to grant a building permit. It is clear that no such building permit could be granted under regulation 5 if a plot did not have access to an existing road.""","""If, therefore, Respondent No. 2 were to grant the permit for which the Applicant had applied and if it were to approve the plans submitted with such application, which contemplated the creation of at least four sites without any access from each one of them to a road, and merely having a frontage on a road protecting strip not forming part of a public road, would clearly contravene regulation 3 read in conjunction with regulation 5 and the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 4 of CAP 96 would thus also be contravened.""","""This being so the Court is of the opinion, for all the reasons given above, that the decision of Respondent No. 2 not to grant the permit for which the Applicant had applied was the only decision which could lawfully have been made.""","""The Applicant has submitted that the refusal by Respondent No. 2 of the permit for which he applied on account of the continued use of the land, which had been compulsorily acquired from him prior to the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution, as road protecting strips, amounts to the imposition of restrictions and limitations on his land plot No. 711 contrary to Article 23 of the Constitution. In the opinion of the Court the construction of a modern port access road with road protecting strips of a standard comparable with those prevailing in other countries comes under paragraph 3 of Article2.3as being “absolutely necessary in the interest of the public safety” and “town and country planning” and, therefore, the refusal to grant such a permit is not unconstitutional.""","""The question whether the aforesaid refusal of Respondent No. 2 has resulted in the constructive imposition of restrictions or limitations in the sense of paragraph 3 of Article 23 so as to entitle the Applicant to compensation thereunder is governed by the principles propounded by this Court in its Judgment in Case No. 1/61*.""","""*Hassan Mustafaandthe Republic(Chief Revenue Officer),1 R.S.C.C., letter G p. 44.

by the letter of appointment in question was stated to be for a period of “at least two years”, continued as a probationary appointment after the expiration of the period of two years, i.e. whether on the 27th December, 1961, when the letter in question was written, the Applicant was still serving on probation or whether he should be regarded, by implication as having been confirmed in the office in question and be regarded as substantively holding the office of a General Service Officer on the said date;""","""(3) alternatively, should the probationary appointment of the Applicant as a

(1):""","""Inasmuch as the Respondent had informed the Applicant by its letter of the 1st December, 1961, that the Applicants position was still being considered by the Respondent and that a “final

1961, was not written till the 27th December, 1961, the Court is of the opinion that the period of seventy-five days prescribed by paragraph 3 of Article 146 began to run from the 27th December, 1961,

hand over to the General Service Clerk, as well as the subsequent correspondence exchanged between the Applicant and the Respondent from the 30th May to the 1st December, 1961, clearly indicate that the granting of such compulsory leave to the Applicant and the subsequent stopping of his salary altogether from the 1st April, 1961, was the result of, and was connected with, the nine alleged offences, involving the misappropriation of Evcaf funds, with which the Applicant had been charged by the police about two weeks after the receipt by him of the letter of the 20th July, 1960.""","""Although, by the granting of compulsory leave to the Applicant until further notice, and by stopping his salary [*8] altogether as from the 1st April, 1961, action had been taken of

Respondents letter of the 27th December, 1961, namely, to inform him that as “there is no existing post to be given” to him his “substantive appointment to the Evcaf administration has not been found proper”. The last paragraph of the said letter, however, affirms that the Applicants “association with the Evcaf Office has been finally severed from the 1.4.1961” when his salary was completely stopped.""","""It is true that the second paragraph of the Respondents said letter of the 27th December, 1961, does not appear to base the Respondents decision on disciplinary grounds, but the last paragraph thereof, by referring to the final severence of the Applicants association with the Evcaf Office as from the 1st April, 1961, when his salary was completely stopped, indicates, especially in the light of the sequence of events till then, that such severence, inasmuch as it took place with effect from the 1st April, 1961, was intrinsically connected with the previous disciplinary action which, as stated above, had already been taken; had it not been for the alleged misconduct in office of the Applicant one would have expected that, in the ordinary course of events, the Respondent would have found it “proper” to continue employing an officer with service as long as Applicants in some suitable capacity.""","""Whether or not it was the provisions of section 14 of the Evcaf Law, 1949 (No. 9 of 1949, which is CAP 259*in the 1949 Revised Edition of the Laws of Cyprus) which were applicable to the Applicant, as submitted by counsel for Respondent, or the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 56 of the Evcaf and Vakfs Law, 1955 (No. 52 of 1955 which is CAP 337†in the 1959 Revised Edition of the Laws of Cyprus) which applied to the Applicant, as submitted by counsel for Applicant, the fact remains that, with the coming into force of the Constitution, legislative or other provisions for the dismissal, for disciplinary reasons, of officers holding public office under the Republic or organs in the Republic, including the termination of a probationary appointment on grounds of misconduct (assuming that the Applicant was still on probation) must be applied subject to the rules of natural justice(vide Stavros RallisandThe Greek Communal Chamber (Director of Greek Education), 5 R.S.C.C. p. 11).""","""It is also significant to note that the practice in the public service in the past had been that, before the termination or extension of a probationary appointment, the officer concerned [*9] was notified of the intention of the termination or extension and was given an opportunity to submit any representations he might wish to offer (videGeneral Order II/1.30).""","""This Court on many previous occasions has stressed the necessity for complying with the rules of natural justice in matters such as these, and in its Judgment in the case ofNicolaos D. HarosandThe Republic of Cyprus (Minister of the Interior), 4R.S.C.C., letter D p. 44, the Court has stated as follows:-""","""“Concerning the allegation that the provisions of regulation 20 are contrary to the rules of natural justice the Court is of the opinion that the said rules, which also under Article 12 are made applicable to offences in general, should be adhered to in all cases of disciplinary control in the domain of public law (vide Andreas A. MarcoullidesandThe Republic of Cyprus (Public Service Commission), 3 R.S.C.C., p. 30 at p. 35,Nicos KalisperasandThe Republic of Cyprus (Public Service Commission) & another,3 R.S.C.C., p. 146 at p. 151) and that, therefore, the provisions of regulation 20, should be applied subject to the aforesaid rules”.""","""Furthermore, express provision to the above effect is to be found in section 35 of the Turkish Communal Chamber Public Service Law (Law No. 2/1960 published in Supplement No. 1*to the official Gazette of the 5th January, 1961) which sets up a Judicial Committee to deal with such matters and which in that respect must be deemed to have superseded previous legislative provisions.""","""In the light of the above, the Court is of the opinion, in the circumstances of this Case, that the severence of the Applicants association with the Evcaf Office, as from the 1st April, 1961, could only be brought about by applying the appropriate procedure for disciplinary matters. The termination of the services of the Applicant, in the manner effected, has, therefore, to be declared null and void.""","""Counsel for Respondent informed the Court that in taking the action which it did in this matter, and in not finalizing the matter by way of disciplinary proceedings, the Respondent was acting in the belief that in so doing it was taking a course which was more beneficial to the Applicant. Indeed, both at the Presentation and the hearing of this Case, counsel for Respondent went so far as to reserve Respondents right to take disciplinary proceedings against the Applicant, if necessary, after the conclusion of this recourse.""","""The Court is of the opinion, however, that once it had [*10] been decided to embark upon what was, in effect, disciplinary action by which the applicant had been detrimentally affected, by being granted compulsory leave until further notice and later by having his salary stopped completely, the Respondent was bound to finalize, in one way or the other, such disciplinary action and in so doing to comply with the appropriate procedure.""","""It is now, therefore, up to the Respondent to reconsider, in the light of this Judgment, the whole matter as also requested by the Applicant in the letter written on his behalf on the 26th February, 1962.""","""In view of the above conclusions of the Court it is not necessary for the Court to determine specifically any of the remaining issues in this Case, though it is useful to observe, in connection with Issues (2) and (3), as follows:""","""It has been submitted on behalf of the Respondent that the Applicants probationary appointment on promotion to the post of General Service Officer, which was made with effect from the 1st November, 1957, was “for at least two years”. The aforesaid minimum period of two years expired on the 31st October, 1959. Even assuming, for the purposes of this Judgment only, in the Respondents favour, that the probationary period in question continued thereafter till the 27th December, 1961, then, in the opinion of the Court it should be borne in mind that upon the termination of such probationary appointment the Applicant would revert to the post of Rent Collector to which he had been appointed in 1955 and in which post he had been serving with effect from the 1st January, 1955, when he was promoted, on probation, in 1957 to the aforesaid post of General Service Officer. Though it is not expressly stated in the letter of the list August, 1955, appointing the Applicant to the post of Rent Collector, whether the Applicant was being appointed temporarily or on probation or whether he was being given permanent appointment, the office in question had, nevertheless, been made pensionable as from the 14th April, 1955, by Notification No.252 which was published in Supplement No. 3 to the Gazette of the 14th April, 1955.""","""Concerning claim (b) of the motion for relief, the Court is of the opinion that this claim is nothing more than a partial repetition of, and is, therefore, included in, claim (a), because, obviously, no separate decision to the effect described in the said claim (b) has been taken and the factual discontinuation of the payment of salary to the Applicant was a consequence of the cause of action which has been declared null and void. The question, therefore, of the salary of the Applicant, which is involved in claim (b), will also have to be reconsidered by the Respondent as one aspect of the whole matter.""","""For theReasonsgiven above the Court declares as stated inThe Order.""","""*Laws of Cyprus 1949, Vol. II, CAP. 259 p. 1986.""","""*Videfootnote to p. 1.supra""","""*Laws of Cyprus, Revised Edition 1959, Vol. VI.""","""*Videfootnote to p. 1supra.""","""†Videfootnote to p. 7supra""","""*Part III p 1.""",]),

Paragraph 2 of such Article provides that a recourse thereunder may be made by a “person” as described therein. In paragraph 1 of the same Article the word “person” is used as denoting a person in his official capacity.
